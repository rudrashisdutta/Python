# `Python PROGRAMS`

---

##

## `ABOUT`

This repository contains almost all the `basic` programs that I have created using Python. It also includes the programs that I practiced or tested certain things on.

##

## `PLATFORM AND COMPILER USED`

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Anaconda Spyder](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Editors were used to create these programs.  


##

## `Instructions`

The [py.exe](PROJECTS/runfile/py.exe) executable file, in [Run File](PROJECTS/runfile) directory, is a beta version for a project I will be working on. Currently it can be used to run any python program or create a python file. It will be have more functions in the future.  

### `Requirements`  
##

[Python.exe](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run the python files.
##

### `How to use it?`  
##

##### `To run a python program`:  
###### `✨` `py` `<space>` `<filename>/<filepath>`  
###### `✨` `python` `<space>` `<filename>`  
###### `✨` `runpy` `<space>` `<filename>`  
###### _Note:_ `Filename/Filepath need not include ` `'.py'` `.` `In case not included, the console automatically adds a ` `'.py'` ` in the end of whatever <filename>/<filepath> has been entered.`
##
##### `To create a python file`:  
###### `✨` `crt` `<space>` `<filename>`  
###### `✨` `create` `<space>` `<filename>`  
###### _Note:_ `Filename/Filepath need not include ` `'.py'` `.` `In case not included, the console automatically adds a ` `'.py'` ` in the end of whatever <filename>/<filepath> has been entered.`
